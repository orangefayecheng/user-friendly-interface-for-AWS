# User-friendly-interface-for-AWS
A more user-friendly interface for AWS users using EC2 services and S3 buckets

List of current services:
- EC2 instance creation
- List the instances in each region and show their ID, state, key pair name, AMI ID and instance type
- Stop, start, terminate or reboot instances
- Key pair creation and delete
- VPC creation and delete
- List VPCs in a region
- Create VPC peering connection
- List AMI by platform (currently ubuntu and centos)
- List S3 buckets with objects inside
- Add or delete objects and buckets

To run the project, download it in your local machine. Build the project with maven. And run it on any web server (we have used Apache Tomcat here)
